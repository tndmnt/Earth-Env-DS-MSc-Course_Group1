    "Through our analysis, we confirmed that Earth’s surface temperature is increasing over time. The data\n",
    "exhibited a clear year-over-year warming trend, with a rise in extreme heat days. These findings align\n",
    "with IPCC projections of global temperature increase. We identified that QBOT (humidity), FSNS\n",

    "summer, FSNS plays a dominant role in increasing heat levels, while in winter, FLNS and wind\n",
    "components (UBOT/VBOT) have a greater impact. Higher humidity (QBOT) was found to amplify heat\n",

    "more frequent, with more days exceeding 305K and 308K observed in the later years of the dataset.\n",
    "This suggests an increasing risk of heatwaves, health impacts, and environmental changes.\n",
    "Understanding seasonal differences was crucial in analysing temperature fluctuations, as summer\n",
    "and winter showed different dominant factors. For example, cloud cover (FLNS) and wind patterns\n",

    "One area for improvement is defining extreme heat thresholds more precisely. While we used 305K\n",
