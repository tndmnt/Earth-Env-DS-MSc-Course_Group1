        "During the practical implementation of this project, the team not only deepened its understanding of climate data analysis but also gained valuable experience in multiple aspects, including data processing, visualization, and time series analysis. In the initial stage of data analysis, we strengthened our ability to use Pandas for data cleaning, including handling missing values, detecting and processing outliers, and identifying duplicate data. We also enhanced our skills in applying Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization, including time series plots, histograms, box plots, heatmaps, and density distribution plots. Additionally, we learned fundamental methods of time series analysis, such as plotting time series curves to observe whether variables exhibit significant upward or downward trends, applying Moving Average to reduce short-term fluctuations and smooth data for better long-term trend observation, and classifying time series data by season rather than only analyzing at the annual scale to help identify periodic patterns. Furthermore, when interpreting results, we learned to integrate literature research and domain knowledge to make informed and reasonable inferences. Through this project and literature review, the team enhanced its understanding of scientific research methodology, including research question formulation, literature review, research design, data processing and analysis, result interpretation and discussion, and drawing conclusions.\n",
        "\n",
        "During the project, we deeply realized the importance of documentation and team collaboration. By writing clear code comments, the code became more readable and maintainable. Properly dividing Markdown explanations and code sections in Jupyter Notebook made the overall project logic more coherent. Managing the project through GitHub improved team collaboration efficiency and standardized version control. When analyzing results, exchanging different perspectives with team members and integrating multiple opinions helped optimize the data analysis approach.\n",
        "\n",
        "In terms of results reporting, we have realized the importance of ensuring that the presentation content is highly relevant to the report output, clearly demonstrating findings consistent with the report’s conclusions. Additionally, definitions of certain concepts should be more precise and supported by references. For example, an extreme heatwave event is generally defined as a prolonged period (typically several days or longer) of abnormally high temperatures in a specific region. In this study, it would be more appropriate to revise the identification of extreme heatwave events to the number of extreme heat days."
